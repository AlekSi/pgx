## TODO / Possible / Investigate

Organize errors better

Optionally use Go 1.7 context

Remove circular dependency between Conn and ConnPool such that ConnPool depends on Conn, but Conn doesn't know anything about ConnPool

Extract types Null* and Hstore to separate package

Remove names from prepared statements - use database/sql style objects

Better way of handling text/binary protocol choice than pgx.DefaultTypeFormats or manually editing a PreparedStatement. Possibly an optional part of preparing a statement is specifying the format and/or a decoder. Or maybe it is part of a QueryEx call... Could be very interesting to make encoding and decoding possible without being a method of the type. This could drastically clean up those huge type switches.

Copy protocol support (this potentially ties in with text/binary protocol)
ValueReader / msgReader cleanup

Make easier / possible to mock Conn or ConnPool (https://github.com/jackc/pgx/pull/162)
