TODO

Should ConnPool get a Connect func, or a Connector interface?
ConnConfigConnectFunc not a very great name
ConnPool logger not from first Conn
New logger interface
Conn.CauseOfDeath name -- maybe something better or remove -- along with IsAlive
Fix ConnPool Reset
Conn.TxStatus -- need interface function or maybe Reset func
Rename Pid to PID


Experiment seems to be failing

Rows depends on internal knowledge of Conn. And in general Conn, ConnPool, Rows, and Tx are so tightly coupled that breaking them up by interface seems very difficult. Maybe impossible for Rows.
